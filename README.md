Project Structure
Frontend: React (TypeScript, CSS-in-JS styling)

Frontend Structure
App.tsx: Root component with router setup.
components/: Folder for reusable components.
services/api.ts: API service to interact with the backend.
context/TaskContext.tsx: State management using Context API.
2. Backend (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
Backend Structure
app.ts: Main app configuration.
controllers/taskController.ts: Contains the business logic for tasks.
routes/taskRoutes.ts: Routing for task endpoints.
Deployment
Frontend Deployment: Deploy on Vercel or Netlify by linking your GitHub repository and setting up environment variables.
Backend Deployment: Deploy on Heroku or Render.
This setup should get your task management application working with basic CRUD operations, React Context API for state management, API handling, and both frontend and backend setup with deployment steps.
